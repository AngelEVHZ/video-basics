## Image manipulation with OpenCV and JavaFX

*Computer Vision course - [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it) - academic year 2014-2015*

A project, made in Eclipse (Luna), for capturing a video from a webcam and manipulate its frames: add a logo in the corner of the video player, convert the video in grayscale, and show the histogram of each frame.

Please, note that the project is an Eclipse project, made for teaching purposes. Before using it, you need to install the OpenCV library (version 2.4.9) and JavaFX (version 2 or superior) and create a `User Library` named `opencv2` that links to the OpenCV jar and native libraries.
